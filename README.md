## Intro

Mother May UI is an automated BDD framework for iOS apps using [UI Automation]().

Wait. What?

Xcode provides an Automation instrument that allows for testing the UI for iOS
apps in JavaScript. The JavaScript framework can simulate user interactions and
test for conditions.

Mother May UI extends the Automation framework to make it simple to focus on
Behavior Driven Development. Really, Mother May UI just makes it easy to write
highly-readable scenario-based tests.

Automate smoke tests, regression tests, system tests and make your QA team's
lives easier.
